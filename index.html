          M2 chip. The M2 chip is the next generation of Apple silicon, with an
          8‑core CPU that delivers up to 15 percent faster performance and a
          10‑core GPU that provides up to 35 percent faster graphics
          performance.1 With a 40 percent faster Neural Engine to accelerate
          machine learning tasks and 50 percent more memory bandwidth, M2 brings
          astonishing performance and new capabilities to iPad Pro. So you can
          create photorealistic 3D designs, build intricate AR models, and play
          games with console‑quality graphics at high frame rates faster than
          ever. All while enjoying all‑day battery life.2

          A complete movie studio in your hands. The high‑performance media
          engine on M2 accelerates ProRes encode and decode. So you can convert
          video projects to ProRes up to 3x faster than before.3

        <p>
          ProRes video capture. Now you can capture ProRes video using the image
          signal processor in M2 and advanced cameras on iPad Pro. Five
          studio‑quality microphones and four-speaker audio with support for
          Dolby Atmos let you record and deliver theater‑like sound. And with
          Final Cut Pro for iPad, you can capture in ProRes and get the highest
          video quality with amazing real-time performance for tasks like
          multistream editing.
